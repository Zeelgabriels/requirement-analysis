# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository contains a comprehensive guide to Requirement Analysis in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). It serves as a practical resource for understanding how to gather, analyze, and document requirements for software projects, using a booking management system (StayEase: Airbnb Clone Project) as a case study.

## Purpose
To demonstrate a systematic approach to requirement analysis, covering key concepts, methodologies, and best practices essential for successful software development projects. It outlines essential concepts, activities, and deliverables needed for effective software requirement planning. The goal is to simulate real-world project preparation through detailed documentation, use case diagrams, and structured analysis.
